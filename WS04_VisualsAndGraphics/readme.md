# Web Visuals and Graphics

Web visuals and graphics play a crucial role in enhancing user experience, conveying information, and making the website more engaging. Here are some commonly used web visuals and graphics:

## Images

Images can be used to illustrate concepts, showcase products, or enhance the visual appeal of a website. They can be added to a web page using the `<img>` HTML element.

## SVGs

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. SVGs are scalable, resolution-independent, and typically have smaller file sizes compared to bitmap images.

## Canvas

The HTML `<canvas>` element can be used to draw graphics on a web page in real time, using JavaScript. It's useful for creating games, generating graphs, or other visual images on the fly.

## CSS Graphics

CSS can be used to create simple graphics and effects, such as shapes, gradients, and shadows. For example, the `border-radius` property can be used to create rounded elements.

## Web Animations

Animations can make a website more dynamic and engaging. They can be created using CSS animations, SVG animations, or JavaScript-based libraries like GreenSock or anime.js.

## Video

Videos can be embedded in a web page using the `<video>` HTML element. They can be used to provide rich, engaging content, tutorials, or background visuals.

## 3D Graphics

WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. Three.js is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL programming.

Remember, while visuals and graphics can enhance a website, they should be used judiciously to avoid slowing down the website or overwhelming the user.
